%h1.page-header Popular Baby Names in the US, 1880-2014

%p
  This is a visualization and analysis of baby name popularity data from the #{link_to 'US Office of Social Security', 'http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames', target: '_blank'}. The data stretches back to 1880, although it's most reliable after 1937 (when Social Security actually began).

  Parents put a lot of love and care into their choices of what names to give their children. This is a dataset, but it is
  also a reflection of familial love and hope; it is a record of the source of generations. As such, things that happen in the world,
  things that matter to people, are visible in it. This visualization aims to make those stories accessible.

  %small (Gender Drift)

.row
  .col-lg-6
    %p
      Shirley was a popular unisex name until 1935,
      when its male popularity plummeted.
      This might have had something to do with Shirley Temple's debut film, #{link_to 'Bright Eyes', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bright_Eyes_(1934_film)'},
      which came out in December of 1934.

    %p
      Many names have changed gender over time, but these changes are most often male-to-female.
      One possible explanation for this asymmetry is that, because of gender inequalities, women fare better when they take masculine names (while men fare worse with feminine ones).
      This matches up with many of our lived experiences and is supported by many
      #{link_to 'stories', 'http://jezebel.com/homme-de-plume-what-i-learned-sending-my-novel-out-und-1720637627', target: '_blank'}

      #{link_to 'studies', 'http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/unofficial-prognosis/study-shows-gender-bias-in-science-is-real-heres-why-it-matters', target: '_blank'}.
      Over time, it could lead to a pattern of female appropriation followed by "male flight", which seems consistent with the data:

%h2.page-header Hispanic Names

.row
  .col-lg-6
    %p
      Many Hispanic names have been growing in popularity at similar rates.
      For example, see this chart showing the most similar names to Julio (auto-generated, not hand-selected).
      Not every name is Hispanic, but most are.

    %p
      This might have less to do with the names themselves and more with the fact that the U.S. Hispanic population
      #{link_to 'has grown exponentially', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_racial_and_ethnic_demographics_of_the_United_States#Historical_data_for_all_races_and_for_Hispanic_origin_.281610.E2.80.932010.29', target: '_blank'}
      (from 1.5% in 1940 to 17.4% in 2014).

    %p
      What if we compared that population growth to the name <em>popularity</em> growth?
      Theoretically, if Hispanic parents give their children (exclusively) Hispanic names, they should rise at about the same rate.

    %p
      To do this, we'll make a list of Hispanic names and sum up their popularities over the same time period. To make that list, I'm looking at
      #{link_to 'these', 'http://www.babycenter.com/0_100-most-popular-hispanic-baby-names-of-2011_10363639.bc', target: '_blank'}
      #{link_to 'lists', 'http://www.babycenter.com/0_most-common-baby-names-in-mexico_10341179.bc', target: '_blank'}
      of popular Hispanic baby names and excluding the ones that are also popular for non-Hispanic Americans. I'm also only considering boy names, because
      there appears to be much more overlap for girl names (which is interesting in itself). Even though we're splitting up our data into
      %abbr#exclusively-hispanic-list usually-Hispanic
      and only
      %abbr#shared-hispanic-list sometimes-Hispanic
      names (hover for the lists), that shouldn't matter for analysis
      %em as long as parents choose them at the same rate.
      %br

    %p
      For the most part, the lines rise at the same rate. This means that the number of baby boys given
      the chosen names is proportional to the number of Hispanic Americans, which makes sense.
      However, over the past 10-15 years the lines have split, and it appears that Hispanic names are less
      popular than you'd expect based on the size of the Hispanic population.

    %p
      A drop in birthrate could explain this, but the Hispanic population has
      continued to grow at near the same rate, so it seems unlikely.
      The simplest explanation is that Hispanic parents aren't choosing names in the set.
      This could mean there are other specifically-Hispanic names that
      we aren't accounting for, or it could mean Hispanic parents are starting to favor either Anglicized names
      or names that are still traditionally Hispanic but not exclusively so. According to
      #{link_to 'at least one account', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/opinion/sunday/for-muslim-americans-baby-aidan-or-baby-muhammad.html', target: '_blank'},
      that has definitely happened with Middle-Eastern names. Either way, it's consistent with 
      #{link_to 'recent', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/us/newest-immigrants-assimilating-as-well-as-past-ones-report-says.html', target: '_blank'}
      #{link_to 'reports', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/28/hispanic-immigrants-are-assimilating-just-as-quickly-as-earlier-groups', target: '_blank'}
      showing fast Hispanic-American assimilation.

    %p
      It's also interesting to look at which Hispanic-American names are growing faster than the average.
      Santiago, Maximiliano, Mateo, Emiliano, and Cruz seem to be "beating the market" and rising absolutely
      in popularity despite a general decline.
